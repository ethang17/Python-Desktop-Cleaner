<h1>Python-Desktop-Cleaner</h1>
<p>
  This script uses the Tkinter library along with PIL in order to cleanup your desktop(or any other folder). This idea came from Internet Made Coder on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zh_mViWbc. The code is my own. I started this project in order to be able to showcase some of my python and logic abilities.

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>This tool moves files of various types into a consolidted folder, seperated by file type. This would be ideal after a large project and a lot of files flood your desktop. Simply open the GUI, select the folder where the files are kept, and select your destination folder. The files will then all be moved to your desired location.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>This was created entirely in python, taking use of multiple modules in order to solve certain problems and create a GUI. Future work may be made on this project in order to choose different seperation methods.</p>
